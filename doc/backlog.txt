I can see the length of a triptrack

From the triptracks list page, I can navigate to the new triptrack page

I can see my profile
  - I navigate to my profile with a link in the header
  - the page shows a list of my triptracks

When I click a triptrack in the list, map zooms to triptrack's marker
